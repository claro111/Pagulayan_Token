# Project Title

LUNA - A sample token project and a program that demonstrates the functionality of the Solidity Programming languge.  The main purpose of this program is to have a brief knowledge about how transaction works by minting and burning.

## Description

This program used a programming languge called Solidity and can also be used to build applications for Ethereum. This program serves as an introduction of how minting and burning supplies works.

## Getting Started


### Executing program

- For you to run this program, we'll use an IDE called Remix. https://remix.ethereum.org/ 
- Once all the code are already done, go to Solidity Compiler that can be seen from left most part of the IDE. And click Auto compile then click compile
- Next is go to Deploy & Run Transactions that can be seen under the Solidity Compiler.
- Click the Deploy button then Deployed Contracts should display all the variables.
- Copy the address then you can now mint or burn tokens!
