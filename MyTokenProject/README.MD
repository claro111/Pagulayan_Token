# LUNA

    A sample token project from metacrafters named LUNA and is a program that demonstrates the functionality of the Solidity Programming languge.  The main purpose of this program is to have a brief knowledge about how transaction works by minting and burning.

## Description

    This program used a programming languge called Solidity and can also be used to build applications for Ethereum. This program serves as an introduction of how minting and burning supplies works.

## Getting Started


### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
    - For you to run this program, we'll use an IDE called Remix. https://remix.ethereum.org/ 
    - Once all the code are already done, go to Solidity Compiler that can be seen from left most part of the IDE. And click Auto compile then click compile
    - Next is go to Deploy & Run Transactions that can be seen under the Solidity Compiler.
    - Click the Deploy button then Deployed Contracts should display all the variables.
    - Copy the address then you can now mint or burn tokens!
